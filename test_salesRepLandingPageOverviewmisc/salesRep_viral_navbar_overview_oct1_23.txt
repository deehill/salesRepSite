potential/test main navBar

--more or less matches the file
 site22aa_layout_of_landingpage_based_on_github.dat
 --for the navBar..

the userReferralViral process requires the user to be able to access the different 
 sections/areas of the site.
-the idea is to have a main "Horizontal Menu navBar"
-there will be different menuLinks
-menu links will be single, where user selects the link, and the associated 
 content/section is displayed
 -or-
 menuLink is selected, and the link generates dropdown menu items..
 -for this situation, need to define/figure out if dropdown menu list 
  is under the "horizontal", or does it happen on the "leftside"/vertical area

-initial attempt at menu links are:


/*
	assume this is "close" to what the app's navBar menu links would be
*/
