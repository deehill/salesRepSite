 Free textbooks!!
   (*cmon.. you didn't think there are really free books)

 bags of money.. large/small
 buying books from us lets you have one of these when you're done!
 books from us ---> leaves you this!
 books from them --->> leaves you that!

anybody can sell you textbooks. We're tying to be different. We're the only 
 operation trying to deliver cheaper books, while giving you ads/deals 
 from local businesses to stretch your your funds!

  here's why we're doing this, and how it will work
  why:
   books for your classes are too expensive and should cost less
   we think theres a better way
  the book platform shows you the books you need for the colleges/classes 
	in the system (~600 largest colleges)
  books go directly from distributors to you, keeping costs low. we don't 
	pad for profit
  you save!

 and here's the how;
  like almost everything else online, ads from businesss local to 
	college communities will support the site
  -businesses are willing to advertise on the platform, "provided":
   		-we show that users want to join for the books, and 
		-we show the user population "data" is a "fit" for the 
		 target customer for the the business

	a win/win for students as well as businesses!

This site/app is focused on giving the student information to 
 join the operation for getting cheaper books, and to grow the 
 community by referring other friends/students.

The business who wants to advertise on the platform, should 
 check out the "bizLink" section for a short overview on what the 
 project offers Ad partners. More specific information for the 
  biz partner, can be found in the partner "bizSitePageLink"!

whyus
-get rid of this.. now in the home/above 



users
-more or less get rid of this.
 expand the home a bit -- few lines..
	to say -- the system needs the students as well as the local businesses to 
	 really work.. both will benefit as the process grows
	the platform serves both users!!
instead of whyus/users sections..
 have a Businesses navbar menu item for a short overview of the business 
  input..

(Businesses)
Businesses
Local Business are key to the success of the TextBook Platform for the college student. The platform 
 allows the business to advertise to the local college community, not only while the user 
 is on the site, but also via targeted txt msgs. The businesses are key parts of the process, as the 
 Ad revenue from the Business, allows the platform to operate, while keeping the price of the 
 books as cheap as possible.

Check out the business site for more information on Local Businesses joining the platform for 
 advertising, and how the advertising process helps lower the cost of textbooks for the 
 college communities. 


(Student/Call To Action)
Call To Action! (How to Help)
projectNeeds

As a Student reading this (or you're associated with a Student), you have a 
chance to help provide cheaper textbooks. We need users to signup(join) the 
site to build the community for the textbook process. The signup process slots 
the user in the Waitlist. 


(Signup)
signup/register to refer other users
 rewards for referral is being worked out. It won't be cash! that would add to the 
 cost of the books.
 -we might take suggestions from the community for what/how referrals should work 
 -since we're going to be having advertisers around the community, the referral 
 process might be a waitlist to allow users to be salesReps.. or to get a slice 
 of the revs... for the college/over a time frame...



signup
Ok!
By now, we hope you understand why we're trying to build the platform for cheap textbooks, 
 and you're ready to signup for the waitlist! The following "dialogs" allows you to sign 
 up to join the "WaitList".

Simply providing the "email" places you on the Waitlist:

Providing your email, as well as being willing to refer others, places you on the Waitlist, but at a higher position.

Providing the email, as well as filling out the userData fields, places you highest of all!

Waitlist process:
 While we want everyone that signs-up/joins to be able to use the platform to 
 get their textbooks. The initial process will be based on users who fill out 
 the data/form in the following manner:

Waitlist category/level
 -each category will have referer checkbox.. 

  1                User provides email, + referer 
                    category 1
  2                User provides email, as well as selects interest in 
				    being SalesRep to recruit local businesses for Advertising
					 doesn't matter about referer checkbox - for waitlist placement
                    category 2 
  3                User provides email, as well as completes UserData
					 doesn't matter about referer checkbox - for waitlist placement
                    category 3
  4                User provides email to be on waitlist - no referer checked
                    category 4


  1                User provides email, wants to refer other users as well
                    category 1
  2                User provides email, as well as selects interest in 
				    being SalesRep to recruit local businesses for Advertising
                    category 2
  3                User provides email, as well as completes UserData
                    category 3
  4                User provides email to be on waitlist
                    category 4

Place in Waitlist by Category
 Category1
 Category2
 Category3
 Category4

signup -- email dialog + referral checkbox + salesRep checkbox
 basic email input form -- with referral checkbox
 does basic clientside validation
	prior to sending json srvrside

userDataForm + salesRep
signup -- to also be salesRep (requires the user to have also inserted email)
 --for this process, this should be disabled if user hasn't entered email
	-once email is entered/validated the form can be entered...
	-would need to explain process to user... would this be too confusing..

or.. could have logic simply have a "radio select" process..
 user selects radio option "X"
 -the app then displays/processes the category/dialog form..
 -the process/section is then displayed for user
 -there would be separate sections/logic for each "category"
	-process/app/section would have to explain/describe -clearly 
	 to the user the overall process before selecting the radioBTN/sel
 -user would only need to select the radioBTN and fill the form/dialog
 -userData form would need user's email as well.. 


ureferral
 --figure out how/what this should have..
	-for now, referral, up to X new users moves user to "top" tier 
	 of being in line to get cheaper books..
	 -should there be more..
	 -maybe ask the potential user/community how this should work??
