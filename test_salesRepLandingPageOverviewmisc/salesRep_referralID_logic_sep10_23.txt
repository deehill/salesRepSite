viral/prelaunch/referral userID
-need app to allow user to signup/register to be on waitlist/prelist
-app allows user to signup to "refer" other users to join
-app would create unique referralID - used/given to other 
 users to view/signup/join
-app tracks the "parent" userID/referralID
-userID/parentID, allows parent/child user relationships to 
 be tracked

when user/parent signs up
when user/parent send email to "friend" user, with referralID 
 passed in the bod/joinEmail
	joinEmail-- is the email contained in the body of the 
	email the "parentUser" sends to the new "friend/user" 
	to join
	-if the 'friend' is a new user, and doesn't want to 
	 user the "parent" referralID, new user can simply 
	 use the 'joinEmailURL' which still has the parent 
	 referralID, but the friend/user, doesn't have to 
	 do anything when signing up/joining via the 
	 "joinEmailURL'
		https://testlpurl.com/refID=foo123
	-the 'joinEmailURL' in the body from the parentEmail 
	 takes the user to the "base/default" page of the 
	 test landingPageWebApp for the user to read about the 
	 process, to decide if they want to join/refer other users 
	 to join.. ie, the viral process of the site
	-the refID=foo123, would be added to the user, that has the 
	 refID=foo123 as the userID's referralID...
	-this allows for tracking....

AdminPage::::
there needs to be an admin page/process for the admin to see/track the 
	ongoing growth of the users
	-as well as which users are contributing more 'child users'
	-as well as areas/colleges/etc.. of the overall top user growth
	-list of users who've signed up
	-list of users who want to be 'beta test'
	-users who want to 'refer other users'
	-users who want to get books,etc..

	-track users::
	-disable user/userID
	-disable ipAddress
	--copy Admin functions from other open source webApps
	

for the viral contributions/rewards
	-need to have some sort of rewards process...
	-allow users to 'select' which rewards they want to go for 
	 based on the number of 'childUsers' the user gets to 
	 view/visit/join
	-based on the number of 'childUsers' the user gets to 'refer' 
	 other users to 'join'...


process needs to immeadiately send 'confirm' email to the user 
	who signs up to join/beta test
	-confirm email to the user who wants to join/get their books
	-confirm email to the user who wants to 'join/get their books' 
	 refer other users...
	-setup tbl with user referralID as required if user wants to 
	 refer others..

process should have 'benefits/rewards/rewardTracking' sections to 
	allow user to track their status...
