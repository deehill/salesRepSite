This doc describes the basic user actions for the "test" landingPage/referralID 
 test app.

The basic "test" landingPage/ReferralID webapp (wireframe/layout) is 
 described in the default -- referral_p1.txt
  

The user Actions for each of the "process/logic/function(s)" is 
 described/follows:

The default/base page allows the user to perform the following actions:
 -Select the "NavBar" menu Items
	NavBar Items -- simply displays the given section of the page 
	 -or- in the case of the "Benefits/Data" item, will 
	 generate a different "page" 

 The "UpdateUserData" navBar menu item/link
	user selecting item, gets user to the userUpdateData segment/page
	 area
		-gives "logged-in user" form with current data, as well 
		 as ability to update the formData items...
		-prob need to make this sep page
  
 The "Signup" Area of the default page
	allows the user to submit their "valid" EmailAddress to Join 
	 the "waitlist" 
		-joining the waitlist allows the user to be added to the 
		 waitlist to test/join the booksite/advertising platform
	Signup Area also has a 
		>>>>"Refer Other Users for Rewards" <<<< (RadioBTN)
		selecting this BTN allows the user to have an assigned 
		ReferralID, which is passed to the "referred" user (child 
		user) by the parentUser

	[
		signup area/login..
		--ok decided that when user wants to fill in the email/join 
			dialog/form, the user needs to go ahead and login
		-a bit of a kludge/overkill as the process to sign-in/join, 
		 requires user to login, with confirmation..
		-stress to user -- apologize that this is to have a better 
		 data capture for potential Advertisers as well..
		 --lemons/lemonade!

		--since the basic "userData" process to join/waitlist 
			requires user to login, fill in userData,
			-have a sep "navBar" menuItem- to handle "userReferralSetup"
	]

Adding new users by existing users --Action::
	Need to define if users need to send emails to add new users 
	 from the website, or if the user should send the emails from 
	 the user's own email acct
		pro -- having the user, sending the emails to the "referred/new" 
		 user, would solve some of the issues with the email srvr process
		con --
			would require user to "track/implement" the user's msg from the 
			user's email app..

	sending "joinMsg" to new users from the website/app
		would allow parentUser to be able to insert "childUser" 
		emailAddresses into the "sendNewUserEmail" portion of 
		the process.
		-app would send "generic" -newUserJoinMsg to the newUser's 
		 emailAddress
			-the "body" would be generic
			-the "from" would be from the "webAppAddress"
			-parentUser would be the "cc" Address..
	should process allow just a "standard/generic" JoinMsg, 
	 or allow the user to "modify/create" their own..

	the "JoinMsg" would have the parentUser's emailAddress, as well as 
	 the parent return email/referralID in the body.
	if the user wants to visit the site, and to join, the user 
	 selects/submits the "returnEmailLink" in the body, which 
	 takes the user to the defaultPage. The parent user's referralID 
	 is tracked, and displayed to the "newUser" if the "newUser" 
	 wants to join on the "waitlist" with the ParentUser's referralID

	the newUser could elect to join, without using the parentReferralID
	 (a user can only have one/single "parentUserReferralID")

	the generic email/body/text does a short invite to the new user 
	 for the cheap textbook site. User ABC is inviting the newUser to 
	 join the waitlist and when joining, using the referralID from user ABC 
	 then helps "user ABC" to earn the rewards for having X users join!!

	email/body also explains that newUser can be on waitlist for the 
	 booksite, 
	-or- can join for waitlist, as well as refer other Users (with your own 
	 referralID) to get rewards as well..
 	(in other words, joining the waitlist, doesn't mean the user has 
	 to refer other users)

	The process needs to have XX students to move on/continue to build
	 the bookstore/adPlatform for advertisers

	[the above text contains a good overview of what the requestToJoin body] 
	 would look like..

	sysActions: -- email/waitlist
		processes the waitlist/email form
		updates userTBL userEmail, referralChk (y/n), referralID

		if user wants to "Refer" other users
		-should user then fill in the userData Form
		--need to determing/resolve this step

		if the user fills in the userDataForm, the process then 
		 updates the userTBL with the userDataForm items
		 -has to "validate" items where possible using javascript logic 
			cleans the data (clientside), prior to sending data to srvr 
			for tbl insertion
		-returns srvr update status to frontside..

		updates the userReferralStatusIDTBL
			parentUserID
			childUserID
			status -- what does this mean
			date - when childUserJoined as referred user
			  --userTBL has userID/referralID already .. no need to store again

	 parentUser
