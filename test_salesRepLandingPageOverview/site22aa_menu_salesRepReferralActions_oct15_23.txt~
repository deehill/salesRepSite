**Rewards/Referral(Actions)
	Home	UserRoles	User -(System Actions)	Rewards/Referral(Actions)	SiteData	PartnerSites	AboutUs		SiteGuide (How To:)
												  SubmitEmailsForUsersToJoin (display section/page with forms/sumit..)
												  ViewReferredUSersData/Stats (data display/layout/tbl)
												  SelectChangeRewardsForUserReferral (from RewardsList)
												  ViewDisplayRewards Items -- should this be systemwide.. or by area?




user selects the "Rewards/Referral(Actions)" link/menuItem
 app displays the child links for the "different" types of "Rewards/Referral(Actions)" for the site
	-"SubmitEmailsForUsersToJoin"	-logged in user able to select the link to submit "email(s)" to 
									 recruit "new" users to join the site. link displays new "recruitUser" 
									 page/section, to allow user to handle inserting the "emails" as well as 
									 setting up any attributes to submit/send off the emails
									-the submit/email process allows the "process" to track the 
									 submitted email via the parentUser referrralID, as well as a tracking 
									 uuid that's included to the submitEmailUrl sent from the process 
									 to the tgtUser in the emailMsg, and then returned from the tgtUser 
									 to the "system" if the user wants to join
									-might have other function/process logic
	-"ViewReferredUSersData/Stats" 	-logged in user able to "view" the list/data/total of the 
									 referred users the parentUser has sent inviteEmails to 
									 -the data will show total inviteEmails sent, as well as 
									  subtotal of inviteEmails that have joined, and total of 
									  inviteEmails sent with no reply

									-process should also allow user to see "top" list of parentUsers 
									 with the same basic statistics for comparison
										good to determine where users stand for getting the awards/rewards

	-"SelectChangeRewardsForUserReferral" 	-logged in user able to "view/select" from the rewards list
									 the "reward" the user wants to "compete" for, or to get based on 
									 the number of invited users who join the site
										should rewards be given only to the "top" users based 
										 on the user getting at least >X users
										should the reward be given to all users who meet the 
										 "goal" >X users join<, but only the top Y users get the reward??

									 figure out the logic/process for awarding rewards
									 spell out -- definitively the reward process
									-the rewards are set by the "admin/rewardMgr" in the Admin/Rewards 
									 site -- with the rewardsTBL


									user is able to select the "reward" for the given timeframe/semester...

	-"ViewDisplayRewards Items" 	-any user able to "view" the rewards list
									 list/tbl spells out what a loggedIn user, who's signed up to 
									 be a "referralParent" -- is able to "get" by referring other users 

									-spells out the "benefit" of helping to grow the community for the 
									 students, as well as the rewards from the Ad/Biz Partners						


 only loggedIn users have access to invoke the Rewards/Referral(Actions)
 process uses sysVar to track loggedIn state
 process "greys" out link to non-loggedIn user
	shows "regular" link to loggedIn user

	greyed out links would be:
		SubmitEmailsForUsersToJoin
		ViewReferredUSersData/Stats
		SelectChangeRewardsForUserReferral


each link displays a section/content with basic explanation for the action/process, 
 and the "form/process" to handle the action/submit

	Rewards/Referral(Actions)

 handle the Rewards/Referral(Actions) funcs..
