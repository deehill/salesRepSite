							user gets "cheaper" books


What are we doing
  providing the same tetbooks as the local 
   bookstore for as cheaply as possible
   -there is no additional profit added to the price
Why are we doing it
  books have gotten too expensive
  this is our attempt at making the process 
   cheaper 
How is platform able to run if not charging the 
 students for profit on the books
 -we work with local businesses who want to advertise to 
  the college community, and agree books are too expensive
 -by advertising to the student/college community via the 
  site/various advertising, these companies support the 
  operation.
Role of local advertisers
 Local companies who want to support the college community and 
  think books are too expensive, want to help "advertise" on the 
  platform.
 The ad rev allows site to operate, books to be shipped.
 Advertisements are shown in the platform, as well as via occassional 
  txt msg.

How are books shipped
 Once the book is ordered, the item is shipped from the distributor 
  to the closest delivery site. This will normally be a fedex/ups 
  associated business. 
 The operation will not ship to home addresses due to "porch pirates"

'about' section from menu
'User Overview/Benefits' section from menu

 We recognize that college students have enough things to deal with. Textbooks 
	for classes that are crazy high shouldn't be one of tham. So abc.com is 
	starting a process to provide users with the right textbooks as cheaply  
	as possible, by selling directly from the distributor and not taking a 'piece' 
	of the book cost for profit. This makes abc.com different from the other 
	online/campus bookstores who stay in business by sticking their hand in 
	your bank account! 

 At the same time, we realize that students want to save cash when 
	buying from businesses close to the college, and a lot of 
	these same businesses want to engage with the college community (and 
	families).

 abc.com is creating an online bookstore/platform, supported by advertising 
	from local businesses. Best of both worlds: I) Users/Students get cheapest 
	books possible. II) Companies get to help keep textbook costs down, and to 
	advertise to customers they want to connect with in a reasonable manner.

 In order to work, we're targeting the College User/Parent/Family/Etc...
	And we're betting that:
		Students are tired of paying high prices for their books
		Students are willing to give Advertsinsg partners a shot in 
		 order have cheaper priced books
		Students are willing to get the word out about the platform to 
		 other potential Users/Students
		Students will be OK with getting their books from our shipping 
		 partners (UPS/FedEx) -- reduces the chance of porch 
		 pirates/theft since ID is required for pickup


/////---Benefits SubSection
	--displayed as part of the 'Overview/Benefits' section
	--give the benefits a 'separation' demarcation/dashed line or something..

 Benefits for Students/Users are simple:
	-Save Students at least 15% on required books for their classes
	-Link the Business Advertising Community and Students with  
	 better opportunities for Students to save on things they need 
	 during the College Year
	-**Over time, create a powerful job/Recruitment Process for 
		the Student Community
	-**Over time, create a lucrative tutorial Process for the 
		Student Community


	*For the user who signs up but also wants to actively/recruit 
	 and refer other users to sign up, the platform gives the user 
	 the ability to get books even cheaper, (along with other 
	 potential prizes)

'gallery' section from menu
'What We Need From You!' section from menu

 To be perfectly blunt, abc.com needs users to sign up to 
	test out the proect, and to spread the word, refer other 
	College Students to test the project.

 We need users, alot, and more of you! As you understand what we're trying to 
	build, and what the mission is, if you agree that You should "have" 
	cheaper books, we need you to spread the word!

 This project has no chance of working unless College Students/Parents/Etc 
	spread the word. 

 The platform needs input from the target audience, to make sure we have 
	the best approaches to getting you the Cheapest books
 The platform needs you to help us make sure we have the ability to get 
	the best local businesses to advertise on the Platform. IE, the 
	businesses with Services/Products you want to engage with 
 The input we get from you helps the Platform show the Local 
	businesses that it's in their best interest to be on this 
	platform to engage with you

 We need you to sign up with your email, to refer others to grow the 
	User community to test this project
 We need users (a lot) to fill out the User Data section so we have 
	as much reasonable information to make the case to the Local 
	Business to be on the platform

 Once the platform achieves XX Users, we'll start the process to get 
	the Local business community on board..

 So, if cheaper books, combined with ads/deals from local companies 
	excite you, sign up.

 In order to make the Cheap Textbook Platform work, the project needs to 
	know who wants to help the project grow and to test the project. To do 
	this, we need to have your email, as well as some information about 
	you via the UserData Form (below).

	For users who want join the platform, and be part of getting Cheaper 
	 Textbooks, and engaging with the Advertizers, we ask that you 
	 sign up with your EmailAddress.

	We also ask that you provide, some information on you so initial 
	 advertisers can have a better understanding of potential users of 
	 the platform. (Filling out the UserData form isn't required to be 
	 in line for the cheap books platform, but it helps the platform 
	 happen for others!)

UserData::
frontside logic requires user to already have an email from
 the emailSubmit process -- in order to process the UserData form
	the emailAddr has to be submitted/validated.. 
	-doesn't make sense to have user fill out form, and 
	 frontside logic not use the data due to email not being 
	 complete/valid..
	-so maybe process should provide "checkbox/radioBTN" for user 
	 to select denoting emailAddr is submitted/ready
		-logic would check the emailAddrSessionVar
			if valid, the fronside logic ungreys the userDataForm
			 for the user to then complete the userDataForm/items..
