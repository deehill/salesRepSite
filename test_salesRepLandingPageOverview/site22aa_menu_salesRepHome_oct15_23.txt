			What are we doing
			  providing the same tetbooks as the local 
			   bookstore for as cheaply as possible
			   -there is no additional profit added to the price
			Why are we doing it
			  books have gotten too expensive
			  this is our attempt at making the process 
			   cheaper 
			How is platform able to run if not charging the 
			 students for profit on the books
			 -we work with local businesses who want to advertise to 
			  the college community, and agree books are too expensive
			 -by advertising to the student/college community via the 
			  site/various advertising, these companies support the 
			  operation.
			Role of local advertisers
			 Local companies who want to support the college community and 
			  think books are too expensive, want to help "advertise" on the 
			  platform.
			 The ad rev allows site to operate, books to be shipped.
			 Advertisements are shown in the platform, as well as via occassional 
			  txt msg.

			How are books shipped
			 Once the book is ordered, the item is shipped from the distributor 
			  to the closest delivery site. This will normally be a fedex/ups 
			  associated business. 
			 The operation will not ship to home addresses due to "porch pirates"


			-this is "displayed when user selects 'Platform Operation/Goals" 
			 from the menu



		--User Overview  /Benefits  [ID=user]   (content)

			 We recognize that college students have enough things to deal with. Textbooks 
				for classes that are crazy high shouldn't be one of tham. So abc.com is 
				starting a process to provide users with the right textbooks as cheaply  
				as possible, by selling directly from the distributor and not taking a 'piece' 
				of the book cost for profit. This makes abc.com different from the other 
				online/campus bookstores who stay in business by sticking their hand in 
				your bank account! 

			 At the same time, we realize that students want to save cash when 
				buying from businesses close to the college, and a lot of 
				these same businesses want to engage with the college community (and 
				families).

			 abc.com is creating an online bookstore/platform, supported by advertising 
				from local businesses. Best of both worlds: I) Users/Students get cheapest 
				books possible. II) Companies get to help keep textbook costs down, and to 
				advertise to customers they want to connect with in a reasonable manner.

			 In order to work, we're targeting the College User/Parent/Family/Etc...
				And we're betting that:
					Students are tired of paying high prices for their books
					Students are willing to give Advertsinsg partners a shot in 
					 order have cheaper priced books
					Students are willing to get the word out about the platform to 
					 other potential Users/Students
					Students will be OK with getting their books from our shipping 
					 partners (UPS/FedEx) -- reduces the chance of porch 
					 pirates/theft since ID is required for pickup


			/////---Benefits SubSection
				--displayed as part of the 'Overview/Benefits' section
				--give the benefits a 'separation' demarcation/dashed line or something..

			 Benefits for Students/Users are simple:
				-Save Students at least 15% on required books for their classes
				-Link the Business Advertising Community and Students with  
				 better opportunities for Students to save on things they need 
				 during the College Year
				-**Over time, create a powerful job/Recruitment Process for 
					the Student Community
				-**Over time, create a lucrative tutorial Process for the 
					Student Community


				*For the user who signs up but also wants to actively/recruit 
				 and refer other users to sign up, the platform gives the user 
				 the ability to get books even cheaper, (along with other 
				 potential prizes)

				-this is "displayed when user selects 'User Overview/Benefits"

		--What We Need From You! [ID=what]      (content)

			 To be perfectly blunt, abc.com needs users to sign up to 
				test out the proect, and to spread the word, refer other 
				College Students to test the project.

			 We need users, alot, and more of you! As you understand what we're trying to 
				build, and what the mission is, if you agree that You should "have" 
				cheaper books, we need you to spread the word!

			 This project has no chance of working unless College Students/Parents/Etc 
				spread the word. 

			 The platform needs input from the target audience, to make sure we have 
				the best approaches to getting you the Cheapest books
			 The platform needs you to help us make sure we have the ability to get 
				the best local businesses to advertise on the Platform. IE, the 
				businesses with Services/Products you want to engage with 
			 The input we get from you helps the Platform show the Local 
				businesses that it's in their best interest to be on this 
				platform to engage with you

			 We need you to sign up with your email, to refer others to grow the 
				User community to test this project
			 We need users (a lot) to fill out the User Data section so we have 
				as much reasonable information to make the case to the Local 
				Business to be on the platform

			 Once the platform achieves XX Users, we'll start the process to get 
				the Local business community on board..

			 So, if cheaper books, combined with ads/deals from local companies 
				excite you, sign up.

			 In order to make the Cheap Textbook Platform work, the project needs to 
				know who wants to help the project grow and to test the project. To do 
				this, we need to have your email, as well as some information about 
				you via the UserData Form (below).

				For users who want join the platform, and be part of getting Cheaper 
				 Textbooks, and engaging with the Advertizers, we ask that you 
				 sign up with your EmailAddress.

				We also ask that you provide, some information on you so initial 
				 advertisers can have a better understanding of potential users of 
				 the platform. (Filling out the UserData form isn't required to be 
				 in line for the cheap books platform, but it helps the platform 
				 happen for others!)
