the "AboutUs" page for the "Home" menu item/link 

the following is the basic layout/wireframe/flow for the "AboutUs" page/link 
 when the user selects the "AboutUs" link from the main navBar
	-from the navBar, the user can select any of the other navBar menu/link items
	-user can also select the "upper right" login/registration/passwd items
		app logic will handle user based on user login status..



**AboutUs
	Home	UserRoles	User -(System Actions)	Rewards/Referral(Actions)	SiteData	PartnerSites	AboutUs		SiteGuide (How To:)







user selects the "AboutUs" link/menuItem
 the app has no submenu items/links for the "AboutUS" menu item. the app displays content for the "AboutUS" 
	overview of who/what/why is the side. Gives the user a bit of insight into who's behind the 
	site/process for the Booksite/AdServer Platform, the cheap textbooks goal.


 all users are able to view the overall data

the link displays a section/content with basic explanation for the AboutUs information. There's
 no "form/process/action" to handle.

	-decide if the link/action creates different page, or different space/area within 
		the current page

the "page"/layout of the page for this section/menuItem still has the main navBar, allowing the 
	user to then select the given menuItem from the main navBar
